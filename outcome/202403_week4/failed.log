RuyiSDK Device Provisioning Wizard

This is a wizard intended to help you install a system on your device for your
development pleasure, all with ease.

You will be asked some questions that help RuyiSDK understand your device and
your intended configuration, then packages will be downloaded and flashed onto
the device's storage, that you should somehow make available on this host
system beforehand.

Note that, as Ruyi does not run as root, but raw disk access is most likely
required to flash images, you should arrange to allow your user account sudo
access to necessary commands such as dd. Flashing will fail if the sudo
configuration does not allow so.

Proceed with flashing? (y/N) y

Some flashing steps require the use of fastboot, in which case you should
ensure the target device is showing up in fastboot devices output.
Please confirm it yourself before the flashing begins.

Is the device identified by fastboot now? (y/N) y
